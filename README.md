# config

a potpourri of os x config files

## install

    curl -fsSL 'https://git.io/vVFE5' | zsh

- this will clone the repository to `~/.config`.
- if `~/.config` already exists, a backup will be made.
- to avoid the [security risk][1] of [executing code over the network][2],
  download and run the [install script][3] in two separate steps.
